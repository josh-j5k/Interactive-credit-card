### What I learned

I learned a lot about event listener, how to intergrated JS into your project and make necessary adjustments to your project for certain functions in your javascript. How to use the console for debugging.

```js
const form.addEventListener('subtmit', ValidInputs)
```

### Continued development

I'll need to focus more on more effecient ways to use parameters in a function and pass the function as argument to another function. I learned that sometimes it's good to think of a functions like a vehicle  with different functions making up the different parts of a car.
